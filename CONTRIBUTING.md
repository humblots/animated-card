# How to contribute

This project is open to and encourages contributions! Feel free to discuss any bug fixes/features in the 
[issues](https://github.com/humblots/animated-card/issues/) and submit PRs to your heart's content.
Make sure to take the time to discuss big changes even further first before investing a lot of time in your contribution.

Note as well that we have a [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Testing
Tests are not yet implemented, if you happen to bump on a bug while using the library, please open an issue.

## Submit changes
To submit your changes, first open a pull request and:
- Make sure that any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of all noticeable changes to the workflow of this project.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
- You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers or of one of the maintainers. If you do not have permission to do that, you may request one of the reviewer to merge it for you.

Try to make atomic commits (One feature per commit) as much as possible, it will make the review process easier.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A description of what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it as we are not using any linter at the moment, but we will soon.
Using the formatter of your IDE should do the trick as long as the code is readable.

## Code of conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge
to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected 
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, 
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any 
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the 
project or its community.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent 
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [PurpleBooth contributing template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) 
which is itself adapted from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4)
